# BUC-5
Spring 2025 - Software Engineering 1 Semester Project

## Vision
BUC-5 is an ETSU-themed daily word game inspired by Wordle, designed for students to play quickly between classes. It will be accessible via mobile browsers, use a clean HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack, and meet university-friendly content and performance standards.
- Target Users:
  - ETSU students using smartphones or laptops

## Definition of Done
- 2 people each PBI
  - review
  - test (min: 1 happy/ 2 unhappy path)
- 3 people -> final release (week 4)
- Meets code & documentation standards
- Uploaded to GitHub

## Definition of Ready
-	Clear description or user story
-	Acceptance Criteria defined
-	Story linked to a goal or value that it will bring to the project
-	Requirements analysis has been performed to ensure the PBI meets the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely)
-	Small enough to be completed within a single sprint
-	Ideally should represent complete and user-visible feature (vertically sliced)
-	The team agrees that it is ready and these conditions are met

## Game Constraints
- Must be single human player (no multi-player games, AI player is okay)
- Should be short duration (as they walk between classes)
- Should be playable on a smartphone from within a browser
- Must be written in JavaScript or any language that can run in a frame within a browser
- Should use touch controls (tap, double tap, swipe, using position of event on the screen)
- Recommendation is to have it use the arrow keys, as the site will already map swipes to the keys
- Must have a name less than 50 characters long
- Must not contain any offensive material: material which would give a negative impression of the school.
  - Including but not limited to: use of expletives, gore/excessive violence, use of controlled substances, suggestive material, racially insensitive content, illegal material, et cetera
- Must not have advertisements
- Must not contain any software which could be deemed as malicious
- Must not contain excessive flashing lights or loud sounds
- Must not infringe on any existing copyrighted material
- The file size of the game and all other necessary materials (including images, sounds, et cetera) should not exceed 10MB
- The canvas of the game must be within 400 x 400 pixels or 800 x 400 pixels px
- Must not collect user data outside of the bare minimum to save progress in the game
- Any non-javascript files necessary for the game to run must be included in a folder
